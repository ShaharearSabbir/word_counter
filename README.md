<h1>Word Counter</h1>
a function that takes a string as input and returns an object where the keys are the words in the string, and the values are the number of times each word appears.  Case should be ignored (e.g., "The" and "the" should be counted as the same word). Punctuation should be removed.

<h3>Example:</h3>
wordCount("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") should return { the: 2, quick: 1, brown: 1, fox: 1, jumps: 1, over: 1, lazy: 1, dog: 1 }
wordCount("Hello, hello, world!") should return { hello: 2, world: 1 }
